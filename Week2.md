## Poisson process (3.4)

Poisson process are the warm-up for continuous time Markov chains (with finite state spaces), which they call $Q$-processes.

- T 3.14
  

## Continuous time Markov chains/Q-processes (3.5,3.6)

Here is where we start to connect stochastic processes to differential equations. It's a good idea to review basic ideas of linear differential equations, like matrix exponential and linear stability theory. 

## Time reversal and detailed balance 

Time reversal is an important idea both in physics (relating to out of equilibrium systems and entropy production) and in machine learning (in the context of diffusion models). 

## Hidden Markov models 

I won't say much about Hidden Markov Models in 3.9, but I recommend skimming this as it comes up in a lot of places. I will mention some ideas for projects involving HMM. 

## Exercises 

(TBD)
