## Poisson process (3.4)

Poisson process are the warm-up for continious time Markov chains (with finite state spaces), which they call $Q$-processes. 

- D 3.13 
- T 3.14
  

## Continuous time Markov chains /Q-processes (3.5,3.6)



## Time reversal and detialed balance 

Time reversal is an import idea both in physics (relating to out of equilibruim systems and entropy production) and in machine learning (in the context of diffusion models). 

## Hidden Markov models 

I won't say mihc about Hidden Marko Models in 3.9, but I recommend skimming this as it comes up in a lot of places.
