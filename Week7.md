## Existance and uniqueness (7.3)

We will prove uniqueness 

## Additional topics: Stratonovich Integral (7.4) and numerical methods (7.5)

# Fokker–Planck equation (8.1,8.2)

The Fokker-Planck equation is the linear differential equation describing the evolution of probability distributions, just like the linear equation we had for the $Q$-process. This now a parabolic differential equation and it is probably the most useful tool for obtaining concrete results about a stochastic differential equations. Especially in the physics literature it is the dominant view of SDEs. 

- The derivation of the FP equation
- Example 8.2 will be considered in detail
