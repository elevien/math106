# Fokker–Planck equation (8.1,8.2)

The Fokker-Plank equation is the linear differential equation describing the evolution of probability distributions, just like the linear equation we had for the $Q$-process. This now a parabolic differential equation and it is probably the most useful tool for obtain concrete results about a stochastic differential equations. Espcially in the physics liturature it is the dominant view of SDEs. 

- The derivation of the FP equation
- Example 8.2 will be considered in detial
