## Probability theory reviseted (1.2)

This is were things get a bit more mathy. To give a proper presentation of stochastic processes on uncountable state spaces, we need to revisit some basic ideas in probability theory and give them a measure theoretic foundation. While is possible to understand a lot about stochastic processes without measure theory, I feel it's important to be familiar with the ideas because it makes a lot of liturature that would otherwise be inpenetriable accesible. At the level of this course you can mostly think of it as a new language to talk about things we understand intuitively, we are not going to be doing technical measure theory proofs. 

- D 1.2 Note that if we are in a finite state space this is just new termnology to talk about outcomes and events. 
- Also take a look at Appendix C, but you won't need to know this


## General stochastic processes (5.1)

The goal here is to understand mathematicians think about stochastic processes in general as mathematical objects. This is not so trivial in continious time since we need to define probability measures on uncountable products of uncountable spaces (hence the need for measure theory). We discuss the general case this week before considering two important examples: Markov Process (generalizing Markov chains) and Gaussian processes (generalizing multivariate Gaussian distributions). Gaussian process are the only example of a non-Markovian process we will spend significant time on
