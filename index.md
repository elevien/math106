<h2>About the course</h2>
<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ethan Levien</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Knowledge of probability theory (20 or 60), Linear algebra (22 or 24) and Differential equations (23) will be assumed.  </p>



<p><strong>Course objectives:</strong> 

This is a course in stochastic processes designed to prepare graduate students in applied mathematics and related fields for research. The course will strike a balance between rigor and practical tools for solving applied problems. Specific topics include discrete and continuous time Markov chains (ergodic theory, Gillespie algorithms), Wiener process, Stochastic integration, Ito's Lemma, Fokker-Planck Equation, Spectral Theory.  

See <a href="{{ '/schedule/' | relative_url }}">weekly schedule</a> for details.

<p><strong>My availability:</strong> I will hold office hours in person Monday 8:00am-10:00am or by appointment. I will be in my office most days 8-4:30, except Wednesday, when I work from home in the morning.

<h2>Course policies</h2>


<p><strong>Expectations:</strong> As this is a graduate course, I will expect a higher level of independence than an undergraduate course when it comes to navigating the material. Specifically, I will expect some familiarity with the definitions and notation in the assigned readings so that I can focus on providing additional context and examples, rather than explaining the basic concepts. No electronics are permitted during lectures. 


<p><strong>Grades:</strong> The breakdown of your grade is as follows: 
<ul>
<li>Attendance (including quizzes) (20%)</li>
<li>Midterm  (20%)</li>
<li>Final (40%)</li>
<li>Projects (20%)</li>
Exams are closed book. 
</ul>

<p><strong>Generative AI policy</strong> Use it, but not too much.   </p>

<h2>Accessibility Needs</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible. Students requiring disability-related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (Carson Hall, Suite 125, 646-9900). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.</p>
