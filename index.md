<h2>About the course</h2>
<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Ethan Levien</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Probability theory (20 or 60), Linear algebra (22 or 24), Differential equations (23) </p>



<p><strong>Course objectives:</strong> 

This is first course in stochastic processes designed to prepare graduate students in applied mathematics and related fields for research. The course will emphasize practical tools and different viewpoints (e.g. semigroup vs. sample path view of SDEs) rather than give a mathematically detialed presentation of any particular view. Specific topics in include discrete and continuous time Markov chains (ergodic theory, hiddern markov models), Wiener process, SDEs, Ito's Lemma, Fokker-Plank Equation, rare events. 

See <a href="schedule.html">weekly schedule</a> for details.

<p><strong>My availability:</strong> I will hold office hours in person Monday 8:30am-10:00am or by appointment. I will be in my office most days 8-4:30, except Wednesday, when I work from home in the morning.

<h2>Course policies</h2>


<p><strong>Expectations:</strong> As this is a graduate course, I will expect a higher level of independence than an undergrduate course when it comes to navigating the material. Specifically, I will expect some familiarity with the definitions and notation in the assigned readings so that I can focus on providing a additional context and examples, rather than explaing the basic concepts. You should come to class with questions and I will always ask for questions <b>before</b> I begin lecturing. 

<p><strong>Attendance and class rules:</strong> The course meets twice a week and attendance is mandatory. Please do not use phones or computers in class except on Friday. If you have an issue with this policy, please come talk to me.  </p>


<p><strong>Grades:</strong> The breakdown of your grade is as follows: 
<ul>
<li>Attendence/participation (20%)</li>
<li>Quizzes (40%)</li>
<li>Research projects (40%)</li>
</ul>



<p> <strong> Textbooks: </strong> The primary text for the course is <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/"> Applied stochastic processes by Weinan E, Tiejun Li and Eric Vanden-Eijnden. </a>


<h2>Accessibility Needs</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible. Students requiring disability-related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (Carson Hall, Suite 125, 646-9900). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.</p>
