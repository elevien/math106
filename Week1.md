## Probability theory background

I start with a breif reviwer of key topics in (non-measure theoretic) probability theory, but you should be familiar with the idea of sample spaces, outcomes, events, conditional probability, independence, marginalization, Bayes' theorem, LLN and CLT. These are all covered in the textbook (1.1, 1.3, 1.4) and are easy to find elsewhere (or have GAI explain it). 

I will review Chebyshev's inequality (L 1.15), Jenson's inequality (1.16) since these are important later on. 

In terms of distributions, you should be comfortable with Bernoulli, Binomial, Exponential, Poisson and Normal distributions. I will review multivariate normal, but it will not be the main event so if you have no or limited experience working with multivariate normal distribution, I recommend reviewing this. 

You can skim 1.2 and 1.5, but we will circle back to that later as preparation for the more abstract theory of stochastic processes. Markov chains with finite state spaces can be handled without any measure theory, so I will cover 3.1 first. 

### Exercises 

1.4,1.6,1.8,1.9,1.10

## Discrete time Markov Chains

The main topic of week 1 will be discrete time Markov chains. 
The plan is to cover 

- Transition probabilities 
- Stochastic matrix
- P 3.4 (Chapman-Kolmogorov equation)
- Stationary distribution/invariant distribution
- L 3.5 (spectral radius of stochastic matrix)
- D 3.6 (Irreducibility)
- L 3.7
- **T 3.8** (this is not proved in the textbook, but I will provide a sketch of the proof at the expense of some other details in the text)
- D 1.10
- **T 3.11**

### Exercises 

(TBD)
